### 1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram. ###   

- The relation between "Product" and "Product_Category" is One-to-Many Relationship.
- The "Product_Category" entity acts as a container for various products based on category.
- It allows efficient management and retrieval of products based on their category.

### 2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it? ###

- Using Foreign Key:
    - Add a foreign key constraint between the "Product" table and the "Product_Category" table.
    - The "category_id" column in the "Product" table should reference the "id" column in the "Product_Category" table.
    - This ensures that every product’s category_id corresponds to an existing category.

- Input validation:
    - When inserting or updating a product, validate that the specified category ID exists in the "Product_Category" table.
    - If the category ID is invalid, reject the operation.
